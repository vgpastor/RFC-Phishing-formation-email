 Proposal for the Introduction of Email Headers for Phishing Detection
                                Training
               draft-vgpastor-email-phishing-training-00

Abstract

   This document proposes the addition of new email headers designed
   specifically to identify emails that are sent as part of phishing
   detection training programs.  These headers would allow recipients to
   verify the authenticity of training emails using DNS queries to
   confirm that the sending domains are authorized to send these types
   of emails.

1.  Introduction

   Phishing remains one of the most significant security threats on the
   Internet today.  Training users to detect phishing attempts is a
   crucial tool in defending against these types of attacks.  However,
   the effectiveness of these training programs can be compromised if
   emails used for training are incorrectly flagged and filtered by
   anti-phishing solutions.

   This paper proposes a solution to this problem by introducing
   specific headers in training emails that would allow email systems to
   correctly identify them and prevent their filtering, while also
   providing a verification mechanism to confirm the legitimacy of these
   emails. .

Internet-Draft     Phishing Detection Training Headers        April 2024


1.1.  Goals

   The main objective of this proposal is to improve the effectiveness
   of phishing detection training programs by introducing a mechanism
   that allows email systems to identify and authenticate training
   emails, maintaining security in email systems and avoiding abuse of
   this mechanism.

   The main motivation behind this proposal is to improve the
   effectiveness of phishing detection training programs.  Currently,
   emails used in these programs can be incorrectly flagged as phishing
   attempts by anti-phishing solutions, which can lead to users not
   receiving proper training or the emails being filtered before they
   can be used for training.

   Finally, it is very important that users can use phishing detection
   reporting systems to improve the use of these systems, as well as
   train users themselves in the detection and prevention of this type
   of attacks.  These reports must be able to discard phishing detection
   training emails so as not to generate false positives, as well as be
   able to forward said emails to phishing detection training providers
   so they can be analyzed and improved.

1.2.  Description of the Proposal

   The proposal consists of the following main elements, addition of
   email headers, sender legitimation and link validation mechanism.

1.2.1.  Adding Email Headers

   The proposal includes the introduction of new email headers for
   phishing detection training emails: - Phishing-Simulation:
   Mandatory | A unique identifier for the training session.  It can be
   shared between multiple recipients, but cannot be repeated for the
   same recipient. - Phishing-Simulation-Provider: Required | The domain
   of the phishing detection training provider. - Phishing-Simulation-
   Auth: Required | DNS record that contains the email authentication
   information. - Phishing-Simulation-Report: Optional | A link or email
   to report phishing detection training emails.

1.2.1.1.  Phishing-Simulation Header

   Unique identifier for the training session.  This identifier allows
   identification of the email as a phishing simulation and allows email
   systems to perform DNS queries to verify the authenticity of the
   email.  At a training level it can be used to measure the
   effectiveness of specific phishing detection training.

Internet-Draft     Phishing Detection Training Headers        April 2024


   Phishing-Simulation: unic-identifier

1.2.1.2.  Phishing-Simulation-Provider Header

   Identification of the phishing detection training provider.  This
   field allows email systems to identify the domain of the training
   provider and use it to verify the authenticity of the email.  The
   same company may have several phishing detection training providers,
   so it is important that this header be mandatory.

   By using user phishing detection reporting systems, you can identify
   which phishing detection training providers are being most effective
   and those who need improvement.  Finally you can use these rules to
   filter reported messages.

   Phishing-Simulation-Provider: example.com

1.2.1.3.  Phishing-Simulation-Auth Header

   DNS record that contains the email authentication information.  This
   record must be dynamic for each domain since it allows you to
   publicly hide whether a domain uses this type of phishing detection
   training.

   Phishing-Simulation-Auth: xxxxxxxxxxxx

1.2.1.4.  Phishing-Simulation-Report Header

   Email address or url endpoint where to send the reported email
   through a PUT request.  It is important that the original headers of
   the email be sent to the mailbox or url endpoint for analysis, also
   allowing their analysis.  Phishing-Simulation-Report:
   reports@example.com

1.2.2.  DNS Verification Mechanism

   Details how mail systems can use the proposed headers to perform DNS
   queries and verify the authenticity of training emails.

   The domain owner must add a TXT record in their DNS with the
   following format: The DNS record should be dynamic for each domain,
   this way it can be hidden if a domain uses this type of phishing
   detection training.

   The content of the registry stores both the emails authorized to send
   the emails and the domains authorized for the links.

Internet-Draft     Phishing Detection Training Headers        April 2024


   xxxxxxxxxxxx.example.com TXT v:pdt1; sender:domain-that-send-
   email.com,domain-that-send-email2.com ;links:domain-links.com,domain-
   links.com

   It is also necessary that the values can be authorized externally, in
   case a provider needs to modify, add or delete domains for both
   sending and links, clients do not have to continually modify their
   own records.

   Provider DNS entry _pdt.example.com TXT v:pdt1; sender:domain-that-
   send-email.com,domain-that-send-email2.com ;links:domain-
   links.com,domain-links2.com

   Client DNS entry xxxxxxxxxxx.example.net TXT v:pdt1; sender:domain-
   that-send-email3.com,_pdt.example.com ;links:domain-
   links3.com,_pdt.example.com

1.2.3.  Link Validation Mechanism

   Validating links within the email is an important step in preventing
   users from clicking on malicious links.  The addition of a link
   validation mechanism is proposed to allow email systems to verify the
   authenticity of links in training emails.

   It must be verified that all the links contained in the body of the
   email are within those enabled in the DNS record of the sender's
   domain.

1.2.4.  Email Report

   When the end user receives a phishing training email that is
   identified by the user as such, the user may use the usual means for
   reporting this email.

   The mail provider, or the email client, when the header in the email
   Phishing-Simulation-Report exists, may send the email to the email
   address or link provided in the header so that the detection training
   provider of phishing can analyze the email and improve its training,
   it is important that this report includes the original headers of the
   email for analysis.

1.3.  Implementation

   1.  Phishing detection training providers should implement the
       proposed email headers in their training emails.

Internet-Draft     Phishing Detection Training Headers        April 2024


   2.  Phishing detection training providers must legitimize their
       authorized domains for both sending emails and links to avoid
       abuse of this mechanism.

   3.  Customers must configure their DNS records with the necessary
       values to allow verification of training emails.

   4.  The email system upon receiving a phishing detection training
       email must perform a DNS query to verify the authenticity of the
       email and the links contained in the email.

       1.  If the DNS query is successful, the email continues
           verification.

       2.  It checks if the sender's domain is authorized to send
           phishing detection training emails.

       3.  It is checked if the links contained in the email are
           authorized to be used in phishing detection training emails.

       4.  If the verification is successful, the email is delivered to
           the recipient.  If any of the previous steps fail, the email
           should be marked as suspicious.

   5.  Users should use phishing detection reporting systems to report
       suspicious emails and improve the effectiveness of phishing
       detection training programs.

       1.  The email system will send the reported email to the phishing
           detection training provider for analysis and improvement.

       2.  If there is no entry for the report, the sending of the email
           to anti-phishing systems will be stopped and it will be
           marked as suspicious.

1.3.1.  Implementation in email sending provider

   When a client of an email sending provider, such as Sendgrid,
   Mailgun, etc., sends a phishing detection training email, the
   provider can verify if they are authorized to send this type of email
   to ensure proper use of the email. their systems. 1.  The recipient
   of the phishing detection training email must have a DNS record with
   allowed origin information. 2.  The email sending provider must
   perform a DNS query to verify the authenticity of the email and the
   legitimacy of the sender to send these emails to the recipient.

2.  Security

   The security implications of this proposal have been considered and
   recommendations have been provided to mitigate potential risks.

   Currently, no significant safety risks associated with this proposal
   have been identified.  However, it is important that senders of
   training emails follow the security recommendations provided in this
   document to prevent abuse of this mechanism.

   This proposal does not take into account the enablement of sending
   emails to particular end users who use generic email accounts
   (google.com, live.com, etc.), however the email providers themselves
   could add this functionality to improve the security of its users,
   allowing each user to enable a phishing detection training provider.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes requests to IANA to register the proposed new
   email headers.
